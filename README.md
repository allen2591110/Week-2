# Week-4
No changes for the Trench Excavation Context 4 aside from the clustering. 
Trench Excavation Label needed some clustering/ merging. Several of them had a question mark in their cluster and therefore should not be merged, because it is not known if they actually belong to that group, but it was mostly Locus 9 that could be merged. Several of them had typing mistakes like Stray Find being capitalized. The majority of changes were adding backslashes, parenthases, or deleting extra spaes.   
For Animal Bones: This required very little merging, but mainly reorganizing as far as capitalization goes. For both sections, thre were splitting due to capitalization errors.
